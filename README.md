# Resume Portfolio Using HTML/CSS/Bootstrap

for downloading your resume or navigating to my portfolio.
- In the portfolio section, showcase my projects with titles, brief descriptions, technologies used, and links to GitHub repositories or 
live demos. Add screenshots or visuals to make this section more engaging. Complement this with a certifications section, listing
